For this advanced challenge, you will create two types of rows in yourRecyclerView: a normal row and a row for more serious crimes. To implement this, you will work with theview typefeature available inRecyclerView.Adapter. Add a new property,mRequiresPolice, to theCrimeobject and use it to determine which view to load on theCrimeAdapterby implementing thegetItemViewType\(int\)method \([developer.android.com/​reference/​android/​support/​v7/​widget/​RecyclerView.Adapter.html\#getItemViewType\(int\)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html#getItemViewType%28int%29)\).

In theonCreateViewHolder\(ViewGroup, int\)method, you will also need to add logic that returns a differentViewHolderbased on the newviewTypevalue returned bygetItemViewType\(int\). Use the original layout for crimes that do not require police intervention and a new layout with a streamlined interface containing a button that says “contact police” for crimes that do.
